# Daedalus-Code V1 — continued pretraining from the released base

Stacked on #14 (`vast/daedalus-improvements-20260824`). This branch carries **only** Daedalus-Code work: code data preparation, code evaluation results, code training and post-training, and this model's documentation. Shared fixes go to #14 first and are merged forward, which is where the trainer's per-source BPB, the held-out preference gate, and the MBPP+ harness already landed.

Nothing here is merged automatically, and no artifact is published outside a private experiment repository.

## What phase 8 starts from

`hero-base-f16` — the released **base**, never the SFT/DPO checkpoint. The plan's mixture is 65% permissively licensed code (Python 55%, JS/TS 12%, C/C++ 10%, Rust 8%, Go 6%, Java 5%, shell/SQL/other 4%), 15% technical and mathematical prose, and 20% original general replay. Train and holdout split **by repository**, not by file or by packed window, and decontaminated against HumanEval+ and MBPP+ prompts, reference solutions, tests, and repository metadata.

It also inherits the released model's 49,152-entry tokenizer and its dead ShortConv channels. Phase 4 selected a 32,768 vocabulary and phase 5 studied decay schedules, but both are from-initialization recommendations for a future V2 and neither can be transplanted into these weights. That is why this is labelled **V1**.

## Base measurements, taken before any adaptation

| Measurement | Released base | Oracle on the same items |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HumanEval+ pass@1 | **0.0000** (0/164) | 1.0000 |
| HumanEval+ pass@1 (extended) | 0.0000 | 1.0000 |
| HumanEval+ syntax valid | 1.0000 | — |
| MBPP+ pass@1 | **0.0079** (3/378) | 1.0000 |
| MBPP+ pass@1 (extended) | 0.0053 (2/378; 1 problem ships no extended inputs) | 1.0000 |
| MBPP+ syntax valid | 0.2381 (289 of 378 generations do not parse) | — |

Checkpoint `cfbf27dc…e153` at `/root/daedalus/final/hero/checkpoint.pt`, seed 20260824, `max_new_tokens` 384, EvalPlus 0.3.1, 30s and 1GB per sandboxed test. Scorecards in `runs/eval/code-base/`, oracles in `runs/eval/code-base-oracle/`.

A 150M base scoring ~zero on execution is the expected result, not a broken harness — which is why both oracles were run first. The oracle feeds EvalPlus's own canonical solutions through the identical sandbox, timeout, memory cap and scorer and returns 1.000, so the base's 0.000 is the model's answer rather than the harness failing to run. Per-item outcomes are kept for every item, so post-training comparisons are paired rather than two aggregates.

The number to watch first is **MBPP+ syntax validity at 0.238** against HumanEval+'s 1.000. The base can continue a function body it is given; asked for a program from a prose description it mostly emits something that does not parse. That is the headroom continued pretraining is supposed to take, and it moves long before pass@1 does — which matters for a 250M-token probe, where a gate resting on pass@1 alone would read every arm as identical zero.

## Preregistered gates

Set before any arm runs, and not adjusted after seeing a number.

1. Three fully decayed **250M-token** probes from the same base checkpoint at Muon LR `5e-4`, `1e-3`, `2e-3`, proportionally matched Adam rates, identical data order and seed. Selected on code BPB and execution pass@1 subject to general retention. **Stop** if no arm improves code BPB by ≥2% or moves execution/syntax signal.
2. A fresh **1B-token** branch with the selected settings. Continue only if general BPB regression ≤1.5%, five-task mean drop ≤1 point, retrieval drop ≤2 points at every depth, and code metrics improve.
3. A staged **+2B** continuation from the 1B weights via `--init-from`, a lower LR and a fresh WSD schedule, only if the 1B gate passes and the controller projects completion before T+136h. Staged adaptation, reported as such — not one uninterrupted 3B schedule.
4. Code and general **SFT** on syntax-checked and execution-tested conversations.
5. **DPO** only if held-out preference accuracy *and* execution pass@1 improve; otherwise the SFT model is the instruct winner and DPO is recorded as rejected.
6. The winning **QAT** recipe applied to the final checkpoint, FP16 and Q4_0 exported, and every code/general/retrieval evaluation re-run from the immutable artifacts.

Final acceptance: code BPB improves ≥5%, HumanEval+/MBPP+ pass@1 and syntax validity improve over the untouched base, general full-pass BPB regression ≤1.5%, five-task mean drop ≤1 point with no single task dropping >2 points unreviewed, retrieval drop ≤2 points at every depth, and the Q4 penalty either meets the selected V1 QAT target or is reported transparently.

## Status

Branch created from #14's tested SHA; parent recorded in `runs/vast-program/code-run-manifest.json`. Base baselines and both harness oracles are in. No training has started.
